# nage

**N**ot **A**nother **G**ame **E**ngine

Well, actually, it *is* a game engine. I just wanted it to start with "N" because the [previous version](https://github.com/acikek/nage) was written in Nim.

nage is a  **text adventure engine**. With nage, you can create data-driven and non-linear text adventure games with only YAML files. ***However,*** in nage version `2.x` and above, games can now be complementarily **scripted**, among other things.

More documentation coming soon! For now, check out this [example Nagame](https://github.com/acikek/example-nagame) to get started.
